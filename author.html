        <h1>About the Developer</h1>
        <p>This blockchain explorer was developed by Dev_Dave, a passionate blockchain enthusiast and intending
            Developer. Dev_Dave is just getting started in the blockchain space and is excited to build tools that make
            blockchain more accessible. This project work was given to me by my Tutor and Teacher <a

        <h1>About the Block-Explorer</h1>
        <p>This block explorer is a tool fully in Javascript, designed to help users visualize and explore blockchain
            data. It provides an intuitive interface for viewing transactions, blocks, and other blockchain-related
            information in a user-friendly format.</p>
        <p>I added functionality such as Toggle theme mode and Search bar . I also made use of <a href="https://ethereum.publicnode.com/">public node API</a> and JSON-RPC methods to fetch blockchain
            data and get functionality such as real-time updates and transaction history.</p>
